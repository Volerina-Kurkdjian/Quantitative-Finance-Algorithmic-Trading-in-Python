Positions

1. Long Position
Means that you own the security
Investors maintain long positions expecting that the stock will increase in value in the future


2. Short Position
Means that you seel the security
Investors maintain shot positions expecting that the stock will decrease in value in the future


Investors can make profit by maintaining both a short and a long position. 

Short selling= you sell something you actually don't own. An investor is borrowing shares and immediately sells them hoping he can buy them up  later at a lower price, return them to the lender and pocket the difference. 
Short selling is much riskier than opening long positions. When you open long position maximum possible loss is 100%, losing the entire initial investment. With short selling there is no limit to how much you can lose, because there is no limit to the actual stock to increase in value.
Investors keep short positions in the expextation that the stock will decrease in value in the future.
